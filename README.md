# Notes from the Surgeries(8 March 2023)
- He won't try to break our code.
- There isn't a predetermined size or number of accounts.

- Think of every post and its comments(and their comments) as a tree.
- Only show the details of that tree branch and the comments/other 'posts' under it.
- Deleting a post deletes the endorsements. Comments aren't deleted
- Generic empty postwill not be included with total posts!
- when you delete a post, that post is down with its id too
- Account IDs can be in any other we want.
- doesnt matter what the name of the object is. we don't even need a variable name. Only the handke needs to be unique. 
- Variable names should start uncapitalised.
- we need try-catch to catch the exceptions! The try-catch is more for the exceptions we need to get to help our vodr tun
